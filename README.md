Advent of Code: palimpsest edition

## What's the plan

To think through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) a little more thoroughy than is usual
for coding challenges, and record the resulting notes/rewriting in nested
`<problem>/rewrite/rewrite/...` directories each day.

## Is it ready for production

SHIP IT

🛂🚢🛳️🛥️🚣‍♂️⛵

## Run it

### Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js v15 and up, because I used
[`String.prototype.replaceAll()`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/0fd121e00c9d5987c20c27a4ee4295da7735d9de/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V15.md#v8-86---35415)
on [day 5](./5).

### Execute all solutions at once

```bash
./runAllJs.sh
```
