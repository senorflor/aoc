# Advent of Code, 2021

Since I am going to be using some more esoteric tools this year, sometimes only for one problem, this year's directory will have the problem number at the top level instead of language-specific directories.

(Also, a tiny learning from last year: for ordering of `ls`, GitHub display, etc., I'll prefix single-digit days' directory filenames with `0`)

## Days 01 & 02: Stacks and Cells

I solved days 01 and 02 in the two tools/languages I first started programming in: formulas in spreadsheets, and Hypertalk in HyperCard. Revisiting these tools, in the light of experience since then, was a joy and sparked some thoughts, which you can find in the README.md files in each directory:

- [./01](./01) (Spreadsheets)
- [./02](./02) (HyperCard)
