Advent of Code solutions by https://github.com/senorflor. Some may still work!

## [2021](./2021)

Going full-on esoteric this year: will solve problems in JS to stay sharp, but then use the problems to explore programming tools which are:

- historically important to me (e.g. spreadsheets, HyperCard)
- things I've been wanting to learn/go deeper on a lot (e.g. MMIX, Rust)

## [2020](./2020)

I decided up front I would work mostly in JS and Postgres, and refactor in nested directories. Made it about 12 days in, mostly in JS only.
